## Task manager
@Chris
- Work on Navbar
- Then work on login (One file is enough. I will customize later for client and admin)

@Me
- Work on news article posting backend: Upload markdown file, title, description, etc.
- Do some frontend templates if Chris doesn't begin working (So that proper testing of the backend can be done)
- Continue updating database to fit requirements

@Done
- Admin login backend
- Not much else...
## Login feature for STT members and teachers
Requirements: 
- Database table for accounts
- Permission system for:
  - Creating and editing entries for
    - News articles
    - Upcoming events
  - Banning users
  - Editing user data
  - Resetting passwords of other users
  - etc.

SQLite databse table: `admin_accounts`
- USER_ID INTEGER UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
- USERNAME varchar(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
- PASSWORD_HASH varchar(32) NOT NULL,
- SETTINGS INTEGER

*Hashing algorithm: md5*

*SETTINGS: Each digit will represent true or false for one permission. E.g. Digit 1 for permission to create and edit news articles, digit 2 for allowing user management, etc...*

## Interactive comment system for news articles
*Plagerized articles can be converted from pdf to markdown via online tools*
*Lightbulb moment: Use python markdown for content. No longer have to do complex configurations for formatting ðŸ¤¯*


## Possible revision section for secondary students
***Saving for last as it is the most difficult. (File handling should be easy, however, ensuring that the files are not malicious and preventing spam in extremely annoying and difficult.)***
