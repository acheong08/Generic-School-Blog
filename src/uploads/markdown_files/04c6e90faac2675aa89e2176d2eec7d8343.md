## Login feature for STT members and teachers
*Hashing algorithm: md5*

~~*SETTINGS: Each digit will represent true or false for one permission. E.g. Digit 1 for permission to create and edit news articles, digit 2 for allowing user management, etc...*~~

## Interactive comment system for news articles
*Plagerized articles can be converted from pdf to markdown via online tools*

*Lightbulb moment: Use python markdown for content. No longer have to do complex configurations for formatting ðŸ¤¯*


## Possible revision section for secondary students
***Saving for last as it is the most difficult. (File handling should be easy, however, ensuring that the files are not malicious and preventing spam in extremely annoying and difficult.)***
